After three months of intensive training, countless hours of hands-on labs, and one AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification later, I graduated from the AWS re/Start program.

The journey from being selected as a scholar to walking out as a certified cloud professional was transformative, challenging, and incredibly rewarding.

If you want to learn how I got selected as an AWS re/Start scholar, check out this [blog post](https://joshcarl.dev/blog/how-i-was-selected-as-an-aws-restart-scholar-in-2025/).

## The Experience

The graduation ceremony was held after 12 weeks of intensive training. It is a celebration of our dedication, hard work, and transformation from learners to cloud professionals.

The ceremony brought together all 60 scholars from **PHMAN28**, our instructors, the AWS re/Start team, and representatives from **DigiPlus Foundations**, our sponsor. There was a mix of excitement, pride, and gratitude in the room.

It was a rewarding experience hearing from our instructors and sponsors, congratulating us and acknowledging our growth. Their words were inspiring. 

And most importantly, its full of opportunities. A career fair was held during the event, where companies looking to hire cloud professionals met with us. It was a chance to network, showcase our skills, and explore job opportunities.

## Technical Skills Learned

The program covered a wide range of AWS services and cloud computing concepts. We learned about compute services like EC2 and Lambda, storage solutions like S3 and EBS, and database options like RDS and DynamoDB. Networking fundamentals—VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups—became second nature.

Beyond AWS, we gained proficiency in Linux administration, Python scripting, and infrastructure automation. The hands-on labs were scenario-based, simulating real-world problems that cloud professionals face daily. We designed multi-tier architectures, implemented security best practices, and automated deployments.

At the end of the program, we were prepared for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. I passed the certification, validating the skills I built over the three months.

## Challenges Faced

The program was demanding. The pace was fast, and the volume of information was overwhelming at times. Some concepts—like VPC routing or IAM policies—required multiple attempts before they clicked.

Time management was also a challenge. Balancing full-time training with personal commitments required discipline and focus. There were days when I felt exhausted, but I reminded myself why I started this journey.

## Key Moments/Highlights

One of the memorable moments were collaborating with my cohort on labs. We'd troubleshoot together, share solutions, and learn from each other's mistakes.

The breakthrough came when I stopped memorizing and started understanding. Cloud computing isn't about knowing every AWS service—it's about understanding how they work together to solve problems.

## The People

The instructors were exceptional. **Sir James Santos**, **Sir Patrick Ignacio**, and **Sir JR De Guzman** didn't just teach us AWS—they mentored us. They shared real-world experiences, challenged us to think critically, and celebrated our progress.

My cohort, **PHMAN28**, became a family. We supported each other through struggles, celebrated successes, and built friendships that extended beyond the program. The diversity of backgrounds and experiences enriched our learning environment.

The AWS re/Start team and **[DigiPlus Foundations](https://digiplus.com.ph/bingoplus-foundation/)** provided unwavering support, ensuring we had everything we needed to succeed.

Before the program, I had basic cloud knowledge but lacked confidence. I could follow tutorials, but I didn't understand the "why" behind the decisions.

After the program, my perspective shifted. I no longer see AWS services as isolated tools—I see them as building blocks for scalable, secure, and cost-effective solutions. I approach problems with a cloud-first mindset, considering scalability, security, and automation from the start.

My confidence grew exponentially. I went from hesitant learner to confident cloud professional, ready to tackle real-world challenges.

## Advice for Future Scholars

If you're considering the AWS re/Start program, here's my advice:

**Be committed.** The program is intense and demands your full attention. Show up every day ready to learn and engage.

**Ask questions.** Don't hesitate to seek help when you're stuck. The instructors and your peers are there to support you.

**Practice hands-on.** Theory is important, but hands-on labs solidify your understanding. Spend time experimenting and troubleshooting.

**Collaborate.** Learn from your cohort. Share your knowledge, and don't be afraid to admit when you don't understand something.

**Stay curious.** Cloud computing is constantly evolving. Embrace the learning journey and keep exploring beyond the curriculum.


## Conclusion

Graduating from AWS re/Start was more than earning a certificate—it was a transformation. I entered the program as someone with basic cloud knowledge and left as a confident cloud professional ready to contribute to the industry.

The skills I gained, the people I met, and the mindset I developed will stay with me throughout my career. This is just the beginning.

To anyone considering the AWS re/Start program: take the leap. It's worth it.
