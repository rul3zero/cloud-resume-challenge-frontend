The AWS re/Start program is a free and full-time cloud training program that provides individuals an opportunity to break into the cloud and tech industry.
## Assessment Stage

Back in 2024, I was searching for a training program that would help me land a career in the cloud or tech industry and I stumbled upon the AWS re/Start program by **[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/training/restart/)** and **[Edukasyon PH](https://www.edukasyon.ph/awsrestart)** , which is a full time training program that equips students technical and professional skills in 12 weeks with free **[AWS Certified Cloud Pracitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/)** exam voucher at the end of the program at **no cost**. 

So I decided to apply, and I took an assessment that is designed to test your motivation, basic aptitude, and foundational skills like logical thinking, problem-solving, and quantitative reasoning. Unfortunately, I didn't pass this stage. But this didn't stop me from applying again for the next application opportunity. 
### Try and Try

Year 2025, AWS re/Start program application for batch 28 was open, so I grabbed the opportunity to apply again. This time I realized that preparation is important for focus and mental clarity. The assessment was not technical, instead it focuses on foundational reasoning, motivation, and basic problem-solving abilities to test and guarantee that applicants are ready and are able to learn in a fast-paced environment. 

After 1 month, I received an email about the status of my application and I finally passed the assessment.

## Screening Interview

I waited another month and I received an email for the interview and screening process. This stage assesses an applicant's personal motivation, commitment, readiness and preparedeness for the intensive learning environment. So, before the interview I prepared possible questions and answers that might be asked during the interview.

During the screening interview, the interviewer asked about my background, current status (financial and career status) and my motivations in the training program. The interviewer also asked how will I handle failures, negativities or burnout in my life which I responded confidently and positively, because of my preparations.

After a week or two, I received an email that I passed the screening interview and out of 
## Final Interview and Selection Process

An update for the final interview was sent after two weeks. This stage is the most crucial because this is the opportunity where I will have the opportunity to talk with the program's sponsor. **[DigiPlus Foundations](https://digiplus.com.ph/bingoplus-foundation/)** is the sponsor of our batch **PHMAN28**. I researched the company, their values, missions, and their goals. Then I prepared a set of question and answers that might be asked during the interview. And lastly, I prepared some questions to ask about my sponsor and the program to show my interest and ongoing curiosity.

During the interview, I greeted the interviewer with respect and showed my gratitude. Then, I confidently answered the interviewer's questions. I expressed my interests by showcasing my experiences and my positive dedication for learning. Finally, I shared my short term goals, long term goals and my motivations in life.

After the interview, I asked the interviewer some questions and tips on how will I further improve myself. Then, I expressed my gratitude and the meeting ended after that.

After weeks of waiting, I finally received an email:
