{{< terminal-figure src="image.jpg" alt="Joshua Carl Soguilon Profile" align="left" width="30" >}}
My name is `Joshua Carl Soguilon`. I am an IoT/Robotics Developer and an AWS re/Start graduate. This is my personalized space where I share and document my works, projects, journeys, and ideas. 

This is also the place where I offer my freelance services from building smart systems, cloud-integrated IoT solutions, and automation projects to creating custom tech tools tailored for specific needs.

Whether you’re here to explore my portfolio, collaborate, or start a project together, welcome aboard. Let’s build something that matters.
