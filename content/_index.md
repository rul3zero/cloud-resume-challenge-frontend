Welcome to my website. I am an IoT/Robotics Developer, Linux admin and an AWS re/Start graduate, . This is my personalized space where I share and document my works, projects, journeys, and ideas.

This space is where I bring together my projects, ideas, and ongoing journey in building connected, intelligent and secure systems. 

From smart automation to cloud-enabled IoT solutions, I design and develop tech that solves real problems.
