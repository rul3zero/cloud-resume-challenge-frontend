title: "About Me"
description: "Learn more about Joshua Carl Soguilon — Robotics and IoT Developer, AWS re/Start Learner, and Cybersecurity Enthusiast based in Cebu, Philippines."
---

I specialize in creating **smart systems**, **connected devices**, and **automated solutions** that solve real-world problems. My background blends **electronics**, **embedded systems**, and **cloud technologies**, allowing me to develop projects that move seamlessly from hardware to software to cloud integration.

## What I Do

I work on robotics and IoT prototypes, from small student projects to full product concepts. My process involves:

* Designing and programming embedded systems using **Arduino**, **ESP32**, and **Raspberry Pi**
* Integrating sensors, actuators, and communication modules
* Building cloud-connected devices with **AWS IoT**, **MQTT**, and **real-time dashboards**
* Providing consultation and mentorship for students and startups exploring automation and IoT

I also have a growing interest in **cybersecurity and penetration testing**, combining secure design principles into my IoT projects to promote both innovation and safety in connected systems.

## My Journey

My tech journey started with a curiosity about how devices communicate and make decisions. Over time, this evolved into building my own IoT prototypes and robotic systems. Alongside that, I’ve been pursuing **AWS Cloud Practitioner certification** through the **AWS re/Start program**, strengthening my foundation in **cloud computing**, **networking**, and **deployment pipelines**.

Through this path, I’ve learned that the best way to grow is by sharing what you build — so I created this website as my **central space** to document my projects, ideas, and experiments.
